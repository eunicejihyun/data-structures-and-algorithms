My attempt at solving the chapter challenges from the book, ***The Self-Taught Computer Scientist: The beginner's guide to data structures and algorithms*** by Cory Althoff.

Challenges are included below.

**Chapter 2**
- Print the numbers from 1 to 10 recursively.

**Chapter 3**
- Given a list of words in alphabetical order, write a function that performs a binary search for a word and returns whether it is in the list.

**Chapter 4**
- Research and write a sorting algorithm that is not a bubble sort, insertion sort, or merge sort.

**Chapter 5**
- Use a list comprehension to return a list of all the words in the following list that have more than four characters: <br>
`["selftaught", "code", "sit", "eat", "programming", "dinner", "one", "two", "coding", "a", "tech"]`

**Chapter 6**
- Research and write another way to find prime numbers.

**Chapter 9**
- Given an array called `an_array` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `an_array`, followed by all the odd elements of `an_array`

**Chapter 10**
- Create a linked list taht holds the numbers from 1 to 100. Then, print every node in your list.
- Create two linked lists: one that contains a cycle and one that doesn't. Make sure each one has a `detect_cycle` method to see if it has a cycle. Call `detect_cycle` on each list.

**Chapter 11**
- Modify your balanced string program to check whether both parentheses, (), and brackets, {}, are balanced in a string.
- Design a max stack taht allows you to push, pop, and keep track of your stack's biggest number in O(1) time.

**Chapter 12**
- Implement a queue using two stacks, but make enqueueing O(1)

**Chapter 13**
- Given a string, remove all duplicates words. For example, given the string `"I am a self-taught programmer looking for a job as a programmer."`, your function should return `"I am a self-taught looking for a job as a."`

**Chapter 14**
- Add a method called `has_leaf_nodes` to your binary tree code. The method should return `True` if the tree has no leaf nodes and `False` if it does not.
- Invert a binary tree using a depth-first traversal.

**Chapter 15**
- Write a function that can accept a binary tree as a parameter and return `True` if it is a min heap and `False` if not.

**Chapter 16**
- Modify Dijkstra's algorithm so it only returns the path from a starting vertex to another vertex you pass in.
